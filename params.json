To avoid that,\r\nbefore installing the game, you must install the libraries **libogg** and **libvorbis**. You can install them with brew:\r\n\r\n  > `brew install libogg` and `brew install libvorbis`\r\n  \r\n##Running the game\r\n\r\nOn your terminal, run the command:\r\n\r\n  > `game-of-life`\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n","google":"UA-42532741-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
